## Projects
### Scoring modeling in marketing research to improve response rate of marketing campaigns
<!-- [Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/8/3048) -->

The concepot of RFM **(Recency, Frequency and Monetary)** in market research extent way back when historical transactions started to be collected in databases. Suddenly, we had DB-managers and analst looking into databases to understand response rate performance to evaluate direct marketing campaigns effectiveness. By simply looking into co-horts based on RFM, analysts were able to notic stark changes in customer responses to similar campaigns. So, in order to improve performance, they would mail customers more frequently who are more likely to respond than others.

### Using Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) to evaluate media and campaign effectiveness
<!-- [Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240) -->

MMM is a statistical analysis to estimate the past impact and predict the future impact of various marketing tactics on sales, can deeply inform marketing plans.
I created a **full stack econometric model** for marketing mix to evaluate the sales forecast, it is important to understand the concept of advertising stock (adstock) decomposition for campaigns, the level of reach, penetration and frequency ordering to manage various media channels. We would also go into details of how sales distribution and price-promotion plays role in creating a full stack economic models.

## The impact of frequency on conversion rates
Marketers in all media are interested in the concept of optimal frequency, few know how to actually measure it. Coommon sense tells us that too few impressions won't generate significant impact, while too many impressions delivered to a given user results in over-saturation and a waster of media dollars.
